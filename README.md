How to run program: When the program runs the user can put text in the give area. The user can the select a desired command. Encrypt will take the given string and encrypt it using the cipher library. Decrypt will take the given encrypted string and revert it back to its original form.

Future work: Given more time, the user interface would be enhanced for more than just input text. The user would be able to store many files, of various types, that the program has encrypted. The program would also be expanded to allow for multiple users and have a distinct cipher key for each user.
